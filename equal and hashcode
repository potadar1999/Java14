Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method


Hash code: A HashCode is an integer value associated withevety object in java,
to get this hasacode value for an object, we can use the hashcode() Method. hashcode
 means it's return the integer hashcode value of the given obect.
Hashcode value is mostly used in hashing based collections 
like HashMap,Hashset, hashTable...etc
and this method must be overriden in every class which overrides equal() Method.

Syntax=


		@Override
		public int hashCode() {
			return this.bookId;
		}

this method return the hash code value
for the object on which this method is invoked
this is belongs to java.lang.object



equals() Method
equal method is compare two string and return true if the strings are equal,
The point of equal Method calls the GetType method to determine whether the run-time
type s of two object are idential

Syntax=
public boolean equals(Object obj)

	@Override
		public boolean equals(Object obj) {
			Book o=(Book)obj;
			if(this.bookId==o.bookId)
				return true;
			else {
				return false;
			}
		}

this method checks if some other Object
passed to it as an argument is equal to the object on which this method is invoked
this is belongs to java.lang.object
